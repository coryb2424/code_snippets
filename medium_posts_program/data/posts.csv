Great choice, you’re in for a treat! You eagerly check NomadList to see what other fellow nomads have to say about the city, and this is what you see:
Tokyo is ranked #293 with a nomad cost of… 3,433$ per month. Ouch.
Tokyo always had a reputation for being an expensive city to live in. The good news is: this is just a reputation. Consumer Price Index since 1992 is a complete flat line. This explains both Tokyo’s “reputation”, and why it’s not as expensive a city as it used to be.
Let’s break down that NomadList cost and see what we think is a bit overestimated (as well as what’s not taken into account)…
…starting with the biggest expense of all, accommodation. Now, let’s be clear: if you’re looking for a 50sqm (roughly 500sqft) one-bedroom apartment, you will probably be disappointed (and wait, are you really a nomad?). The cheapest, most convenient, and basic go-to option for those who want to stay a couple of months are share house. It also happens to be a really good way to meet locals and fellow travelers, and you won’t be annoyed by paperwork.
Here is a list of links to find your next home in Tokyo:
Sakura House, Oak House, Borderless House, TokyoCityApt, Create, Craigslist
You can also find more nomad-dedicated places, like Tokyo Chapter or BeLiving. They’ll organize events, introduce entrepreneurs, and overall connect you to the right people.
Last but not least, you don’t need to be in the city center. It’s even difficult to pinpoint what the actual city center is, and it often refers to very posh neighborhoods dedicated to expat living. There is so much more Tokyo can offer in terms of local living, and up-and-coming areas such as Shimo-Kitazawa or Meguro can be a perfect base for a short stay.
One last thing you need to know: rents are very “linear” in Tokyo, and mostly depend on the neighborhood, distance from the nearest station and building construction year. This means two things: you’ll always get what you pay for, and you have access to the full range of prices.
Budget: 80,000–100,000¥ / month (700–900$)
Now you have a place to stay. What do you eat? On this side, it’s difficult to argue with the NomadList rate: 800¥ for a lunch and 1,200¥ for dinner will be the minimum you’ll spend.
Budget: 3,000¥ / day (25$)
That’s when things can get out of hands pretty fast. A lot of places offer all you can eat & drink for as low as 3,000¥, but if you’re the party type you’ll probably hop from one bar to another, and finish your night (or early morning) in one of the local clubs.
Budget: 8,000¥ per party night (70$)
Transportation in Tokyo is not cheap. That makes the choice of your home + base coworking combo very strategic: you basically want to be able to get to work by bicycle every day. Getting your hands on a bicycle itself is pretty easy, and sites like Craigslist or Sayonara Sale lists options for all budgets. Fun fact, since it’s costly to get rid of pieces of furniture, fridge, television, etc… a lot of foreigners leaving Tokyo will just give them away.
Now if you really have to, a train ride can cost anywhere between 1 and 3$ depending on where you’re staying, and there are very few discount options. And yes, avoid rush hour.
Budget: 5,000¥ (45$) for a bicycle, 300 to 600¥ (2–5$) a day for commute.
We did an extensive reviews of the best nomad-friendly coworking spaces in Tokyo, some of them even including accommodation in their offering:
In terms of budget, Nomadlist is probably overestimating a bit, as most places to remote work are 40,000¥ (350$) a month and below. For drop-in options the range is usually 1,500–2,000¥ (12–17$), and when push comes to shove you still can stay at a Starbucks, which are everywhere, for a whole day.
Budget: 20,000¥ to 40,000¥ monthly (180$ to 350$)
Five years ago travelling to Japan was sometimes turning into a Wifi hunt: most coffee shops did not have free wifi, and getting a temporary SIM card was basically impossible. MVNOs came in, and you have now access to the full range of plans, from 1Gb single-use to 2-month (almost) unlimited data.
TokyoCheapo is keeping an almost exhaustive list of offers up-to-date:
Speaking of TokyoCheapo, as its name stands it is going to be your go-to resource for all the good deals around the city, from cheap accommodation to free sightseeing experience.
Budget: 2,000 to 3,000¥ monthly (18$ to 27$)
Not accounting for flight ticket, our overall monthly budget starts at 180,000¥, or roughly 1,600$. Getting to Tokyo while on an Asia tour (think Bali, Vietnam and Thailand for example) might be your best bet, and you can find rather cheap flights to and from those destinations, starting at 350$.
Should you come? If you are a Nomadlist fan and going down the list city by city, with Tokyo ranked at #293 you may actually never get there. But listen 2 minutes to Anthony Bourdain talking about the city, experience it by yourself, and you might reconsider your nomad life for a second!
Lastly, if you’re considering nomading to Tokyo, feel free to ping us, and we’ll be happy to guide you through the city.

le-wagon/this-is-what-a-developer-looks-like-379c261db24d,This is what a developer looks like,"Lola likes reading and wearing dad hats. But above all, Lola loves coding. She loves it so much that she has made it her passion, and ultimately, her job.
Lola studied translation, linguistics and literature at university. She then worked as a freelance translator for a while, and ended up working in marketing, which she didn’t really enjoy. One day, she decided to learn to code. As two of her friends had done Le Wagon and loved it, she quit her job and joined the next Paris batch.
Her studying at Le Wagon was just the beginning of her coding journey. As she had almost finished the bootcamp, one of her teachers asked her if she would like to become a Teaching Assistant. She immediately said yes.
I have been working in the tech space for 4 years, so I’m used to seeing few women around, especially in technical teams. When I joined Le Wagon a few weeks ago, I immediately noticed amazing and passionate women developers around me. Not being a developer myself (though I have already considered it), I asked them how they felt about coding, and why they thought so few women were interested in it.
So I asked Lola what she loved about coding. Her answer is compelling 😍
Beautiful, isn’t it? And besides being beautiful, it makes the perfect intro to a very important point.
It may well be that you related to what Lola depicted above. You may have told yourself “wow, this seems fantastic, this stuff was made for me. I need to start coding right away”. And maybe you didn’t. What I’m certain about is that it has nothing to do with your being a 👨‍🎓 or a 👩‍🎓.
To make sure that I got it right, I asked other girls what they loved about coding. Girls working at Le Wagon: developers, teachers, teaching assistants.
This is what Sandrine, developer and teacher at Le Wagon, told me.
“I love coding for a ton of different reasons: I love the fact that I can work on a problem and see immediate results — positive or negative. It requires you to dive deep into a problem, there is no room for bullshit or half-assed solutions.
The challenge is also what Cecile, part-time Le Wagon teacher, part-time freelance developer, enjoys in her job: “being a developer means being constantly challenged, every day”. There is something else that she is fond of: bringing to life projects that she cares about.
“What I love about web development is that you can bring your expertise to every sector that you like. I used to work for an e-commerce fashion website, then for an auction platform, now I work with Fizzer, an awesome app created by two Le Wagon alumni. I can help bring to life all the projects I believe in.”
Intellectual challenge ✅ Constant learning ✅ Daily victories ✅ Are these especially male or female stuff?
Karine used to be a designer. She did Le Wagon, and now, she is a full-time developer, teacher and co-founder of web agency Poulpe.
Freedom ✅ Creativity ✅ Empowerment ✅ Again, especially male or female stuff?
At Le Wagon, bringing more women to code is a real challenge. Slowly but surely, we’re getting there, some cities being more successful than others in that matter 😬
Coding should appeal to girls and boys equally, right? But the reality is quite different.
Of course, these figures are biased: percentages vary from batch to batch. For instance, Barcelona has had 27% female students since it launched, and this latest batch is not representative of the city’s diversity efforts. But on the whole, among the latest Le Wagon batches across the world — and throughout Le Wagon’s history — women have represented 25% of the students on average. We could be satisfied by this figure. After all, it is still higher than the average percentage of women in many companies’ tech teams.
We receive more and more applications from women, but there are still too few of them. We feel sorry that so few women feel like coding is for them. We feel sorry that so few women have the opportunity to use this very empowering and fulfilling tool that is web development 💥
If coding is a matter of “hard work, drive, self-confidence and a hunger for learning” (I took that from Sandrine), then why is the field lacking women? And why do we associate the word “developer” to a grumpy guy instead of a smiling girl? 💃
For Alice, developer and teacher at Le Wagon Berlin, many women don’t even think that coding could be a choice for them. It seems that the good old developer image is deeply rooted in our collective unconscious.
But hey! Alice also thinks that this pattern is quickly evolving, and that it is partly due to the nature of the profession: “On the technological side, we constantly need to evolve, so on the social side that happens as well. Change can be very, very fast.”
💪💪💪
So, close your eyes and tell me: what does a developer look like now?
